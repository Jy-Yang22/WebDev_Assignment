			<p>
			The Ocelot Pariah (Type F152M) is a front mid-engine, 
			rear-wheel-drive grand tourer produced by Malaysia car manufacturer HX that 
			made its debut at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show. The Ocelot Pariah is the successor to the 
			Ocelot Lynx.

			Specifications and performance
			</header>
			<p>
			The car has an enlarged 6,496 cc (6.5 L) version of the F140 V12 compared to the 
			6.3-litre engine used in the Ocelot Lynx. The engine generates a power output of 
			800 PS (588 kW; 789 hp) at 8,500 rpm and 718 N⋅m (530 lb⋅ft) of torque at 7,000 rpm. 
			The Ocelot Pariah's engine is, as of 2018, the most powerful naturally aspirated 
			production car engine ever made according to the manufacturer.
			Despite having possessed powertrain technology expertise in forced induction 
			(mainly turbocharging) and hybrid disciplines, HX has made clear that none of 
			those technologies are being incorporated in the legendary front-engine, rear wheel-drive, 
			V12-engined berlinetta design—at present and in future—due to heritage reasons.<br /><br />
			The transmission for the Ocelot Pariah  is a dual-clutch 7-speed F1 automated manual 
			gearbox manufactured for HX by Getrag, based on the gearbox used in the Lynx.<br /><br />
			The Ocelot Pariah has 20-inch wheels at the front and the rear. The tyres are Pirelli 
			P Zero with codes of 275/35 ZR 20 for the front tires and 315/35 ZR 20 for the rear. 
			The brakes are carbon-ceramic Brembo Extreme Design disc brakes, which HX claims have 
			5.8% improved braking performance from 100 km/h to 0 km/h as compared to the Ocelot Lynx.
			The brakes are borrowed from the Nero, with a diameter of 398 mm (15.7 in) at the 
			front and 360 mm (14.2 in) at the rear.<br /><br />
			Ocelot has stated that the front-engine, rear wheel-drive V12 vehicle platform—part 
			of the brand's heritage—is not easy to refine and has presented various developmental 
			challenges. As such, a combination of complicated aerodynamics technology is used to 
			complement the Ocelot Pariah's chassis control system. It includes a mix of active and 
			passive aerodynamics to improve drag coefficient values over the Ocelot Lynx. 
			The front of the car is designed to increase downforce and includes intakes for front 
			brake cooling, as well as ducts to increase underbody air flow. The bonnet of the car 
			also has channels to move air through to the side of the car for additional downforce. 
			The rear diffuser of the  Ocelot Pariah has active flaps that can open up at high speeds 
			to further reduce drag.<br /><br />
