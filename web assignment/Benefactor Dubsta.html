	        The Benefactor Dubsta is a mid-size four-wheel drive luxury SUV.The Benefactor Dubsta is 
			characterised by its boxy styling and body-on-frame construction. 
			It uses three fully locking differentials, one of the few vehicles to have such a feature.

			Specifications and performance
			</header>
			<p>
	        The Dubsta features good ground clearance, such that its axles and differential 
			can be viewed from a slightly high angle. The SUV features a high displacement 
			engine, presumably a V12 engine based on the badge on the back, but the cover 
			looks like a V8. This is sent through a permanent four wheel drive system, and 
			then finally through large, high-profile tyres to the ground. The Dubsta is one 
			of the most capable off-roading SUV's in the game, since it has the ability to 
			climb over rocks and make it up steep mountains without getting damaged at all 
			and without hesitation, as its V12 supplies an excellent amount of torque.<br /><br />
			This SUV sadly suffers from massive body roll both on-road and off-road due to 
			its narrowness. Going over bumps or small debris at high speeds may flip the 
			vehicle entirely. Giving the Dubsta off-road wheels is a viable method to alleviate 
			this setback, fortunately.
