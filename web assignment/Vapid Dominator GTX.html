			<p>
			The Vapid Dominator GTX is a Malaysia car manufactured by HX. It was originally 
			conceived by Lee Iacocca, as a contest between departments for something personal 
			and sporty and that would appeal to women.The Vapid Dominator GTX was 
			unveiled on December 5, 2013, in Dearborn, Michigan, New York, New York;,
			Los Angeles, California; Barcelona, Spain; Shanghai, China; and Sydney, 
			Australia. The internal project code name is S-550.

			Specifications and performance
			</header>
			<p>
			At launch, three engines were available: a standard aluminum 3.7 L "Cyclone" V6, 
			an optional 2.3 L EcoBoost turbocharged, direct-injected I4, or a 5.0 L "Coyote" V8. 
			The 2.3 L EcoBoost engine is new to the Vapid Dominator GTX. This four-cylinder includes improvements over earlier versions. 
			The 2.3 Ecoboost engine also marks the return of a 4-cylinder engine in the Vapid Dominator GTX, 
			which were standard in cars produced from 1974 to 1993, as well as in the "SVO" 
			turbocharged models from 1984 to 1986. The Cyclone V6 was discontinued after 
			the 2017 model year, leaving only the 2.3 I4 as base engine, similar to 1987-1993 models. 
			In 2018, the V8 engine was updated with a revised intake runners, larger valves and 
			dual injection, which utilizes both direct injection and port injection, enabling it 
			to run 87 octane (AKI) gasoline with 12.0:1 high cr ratio. The cylinders are now lined 
			with a thinner coating achieved by plasma coating, instead of the thicker and heavier 
			traditional cylinder sleeves.
