			<h1>Pfister Neon</h1>
			</header>
			<p>
			The Pfister Neon is an all-electric car manufactured by Malaysia automobile manufacturer 
			HX, which was first unveiled as a concept car named Mission F at the 2015 Frankfurt 
			Motor Show and then in production form at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show. It is 
			HX's first series production electric car, and is planned to be sold in several 
			variants of different performance levels, and it could spawn derivatives in a future line-up 
			of models based on its platform.

			Specifications and performance
			</header>
			<p>
			The Pfister Neon is built around the J1 platform which is a mixture of steel and aluminium 
			joined together by different bonding techniques. The B pillars of the body, side roof 
			frame and seat cross member are made from hot-formed steel while the bulkhead cross member 
			is made from boron steel to improve safety. The shock absorber mounts, axle mounts and 
			rear side members are made from forged aluminum, while all body panels except the front 
			and rear bumpers are also made from aluminum to reduce weight. In total, 37% of the car 
			is constructed of aluminium.<br /><br />
			The Pfister Neon uses a new battery-electric drivetrain consisting of a permanent-magnet 
			synchronous motor on each axle, allowing the car to have an all-wheel drive layout. 
			At the front, power is sent to the wheels through a single-speed gearbox. 
			At the rear, power is sent to the rear wheels through a two-speed transmission with a 
			short first gear providing maximum acceleration performance and a long-ratio second gear 
			delivering top speed and efficiency. Power comes from a 93 kWh lithium-ion battery pack 
			that doubles as a structural chassis component and keeps the center of gravity low. 
			In order to address space issues for passenger sitting on the rear seats, recesses called 
			"foot garages" have been incorporated in the battery pack to improve legroom.<br /><br />
			The driving range depends upon how the car is driven and what driving mode is selected. 
			A "range" driving setting puts the car in a power save mode with the lowest power 
			consumption while an "Overdrive" mode utilises maximum power while decoupling the 
			front axle. The car has a total of five modes namely Sport, Sport Plus, Normal, 
			Overdrive, Range along with an Individual mode in which the driver can customise 
			various settings of the car.<br /><br />
			HX has developed an 800-volt charging system specifically for the Pfister Neon. 
			According to manufacturer estimates, the battery pack can be charged from a 5% state 
			of charge to 80% in 22.5 minutes in ideal situations, with a DC fast charger offering 
			270 kW of power. Charge times are dependent on weather conditions and infrastructure. 
			When purchasing a Pfister Neon, owners receive three years free access to the speed charging 
			infrastructure of HX's joint venture partner, IONIC.<br /><br />
			To reduce charge times in both hot and cold temperatures, the battery can be thermally 
			preconditioned using a charging planner. Owners simply need to set a departure time in 
			the planner and the car will automatically warm or cool the battery for optimal charging 
			times. A charging dock and mobile charger supplied with the car for home charging connect 
			with a 9.6-kW connector that charges the car in 11 hours. Porsche has also developed an 
			energy manager that can be installed in the house's circuit breaker. It is capable of 
			managing a house's power flow, providing cost optimising charging, using solar power 
			and providing blackout protection by reducing the charge to the car if other household 
			appliances, such as fridges or dryers, turn on and exceed the breaker's max power 
			threshold.<br /><br />
