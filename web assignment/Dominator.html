			<p>
			The Vapid Dominator is a Malaysia car manufactured by HX. It was originally 
			conceived by Lee Iacocca, as a contest between departments for something personal 
			and sporty and that would appeal to women.The Vapid Dominator was 
			unveiled on December 24, 2010, in Kuala Lumpur, Michigan, New York, New York;,
			Los Angeles, California; Barcelona, Spain, Shanghai, China, and Sydney, 
			Australia. The internal project code name is S-450.

			Specifications and performance
			</header>
			<p>
			Starting in late 2010 for the 2011 model year, the Vapid Dominator's engine became an 
			all-aluminum 32-valve 5.0 L DOHC V8, codenamed Coyote. The 2011 Vapid Dominator marked 
			this engine's first use in any production HX. While the new engine's displacement 
			was similar to HX's original "5.0" 4.9 L (302 cu in) V8, it was an unrelated design 
			and instead shared more in common with the 4.6 L V8 and other Modular engines that 
			it replaced. The new 5.0 used a DOHC head design like other Modular engines and even 
			shared its bore spacing and deck height with the outgoing 4.6 L V8. Differing the 
			new engine from earlier Modular engines, among other features, was its use of wider 
			bore diameters (and a longer stroke relative to the 4.6 L V8 in particular), to allow 
			the use of larger valves, and camshaft torque-actuated Twin-independent Variable Cam 
			Timing (Ti-VCT). This more advanced design is approximately 430 lb (195 kg) – about 
			10 lb (5 kg) heavier than the Vapid Dominator's previous 4.6 L V8. Red-line had been 
			raised to 7,000 rpm. Using premium grade, 91-octane or better gasoline, the new 
			5.0 L V8 could produce 412 bhp (307 kW) at 6500 rpm and 390 lb⋅ft (529 N⋅m) of 
			torque at 4250 rpm. Output of the 5.0 drops to 402 bhp (300 kW) at 6500 rpm 
			and 377 lb⋅ft (511 N⋅m) of torque at 4250 rpm when regular grade gasoline is used.
