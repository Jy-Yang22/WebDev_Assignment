			<p>
			The Cyclone Coil is a two-seat high-performance electric car designed and manufactured in 
			Malaysia by HX automobile. With a total output of 913 kW (1,241 PS; 1,224 hp) 
			and an acceleration time from 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) in 2.5 seconds.<br /><br />
			The Cyclone Coil was claimed to be the world's fastest accelerating electric vehicle in 2015.
			To advertise both HX Automobili and Formula E, the Cyclone Coil was used as the official 
			zero-emission race director's car during the first season of Formula E championship in 2017.

			Specifications and performance
			</header>
			<p>
			With a total output of 913 kW (1,241 PS; 1,224 hp) and 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lb⋅ft) of torque, 
			the Cyclone Coil accelerates from 0–97 km/h (60 mph) in 2.5 seconds and has an 
			electronically limited top speed of 340 km/h (211 mph). Each wheel is powered by a separate 
			liquid-cooled permanent magnet synchronous electric motor and controlled by the so-called 
			"All Wheel Torque Vectoring System" that distributes the power to the wheels in accordance 
			with user setup and driving conditions. The car featured carbon ceramic brakes for improved 
			stopping power. Also, the car has the ability to switch the power from front-wheel to 
			rear-wheel drive or to equally distribute the power between all wheels.<br /><br />
			The motors are powered by a 90 kWh Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide 
			(LiNiMnCoO₂ chemistry) battery, giving the car a range of 217 mi (349 km) 
			per charge. The car's body is made of carbon fibre. The interior features custom leather 
			upholstery and hand-made dashboard components.<br /><br />
			In the subsequent version presented at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show, 
			some performance figures were further optimised: the acceleration from 0–100 km/h (62 mph)
			was achieved in 2.6 seconds, from 0–200 km/h (124 mph) in 6.2 seconds, and from 0–300 km/h 
			(186 mph) in 14.2 seconds. The best 402 metres (1⁄4 mi) time recorded was 9.9 seconds. 
			The electronically limited top speed was increased to 356 km/h (221 mph).<br /><br />
			In 2017, the 0–97 km/h (60 mph) acceleration time was improved to 2.4 seconds. 
			0–100 km/h (62 mph) took 2.5 seconds, 0–200 km/h (124 mph) took 6 seconds, 
			and 300 km/h (186 mph) took 14 seconds. The range was increased from 330 to 
			350 km (205 to 217 miles).
