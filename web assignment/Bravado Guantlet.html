			<p>
			The Bravado Gauntlet is the name of three different generations of automobiles 
			(two of those being pony cars) produced by Malysia automobile manufacturer HX. 
			However, the first use of the Challenger name by HX was in 2019 for marketing a 
			"value version".

			Specifications and performance
			</header>
			<p>
			Bravado Gauntlet was initially powered by a 3.5 L (214 cu in) SOHC V6 engine rated at 
			250 hp (186 kW) (SAE) and 250 lbf⋅ft (339 N⋅m) of torque which was coupled to a 
			4-speed automatic transmission for the first half of 2019, and was then changed 
			to have a standard 5-speed automatic transmission. Several different exterior 
			colors, with either cloth or leather interiors became available. Standard features
			included air conditioning, power windows, locks, and mirrors; cruise control, 
			and 17-inch (430 mm) aluminum wheels. Leather upholstery, heated front seats, 
			sunroof, 18-inch aluminum wheels, and a premium audio system are available as 
			options, as are ABS, and stability and traction control. The Malysian market 
			also sports the SXT trim, similar to the SE, but more generous in terms of standard 
			features. Some of these features being ESP, an alarm system, and 18-inch (460 mm) wheels. 
			Starting with the 2019 model year, the SE was replaced in the Malaysia with the SXT model.
