			<h1>Truffade Nero</h1>
			</header>
			<p>
			The Truffade Nero is a mid-engine two-seater sports car developed and manufactured in TARUC, 
			KL by automobile manufacturer HX. 
			The successor to the Truffade Adder, the Nero was first shown at the Geneva Motor Show on 1 March 2019.
			The car is based on the Truffade Vision Gran Turismo concept car.

			Specifications and performance
			</header>
			<p>
			The main carry over component from the Adder is the 7,993 cc (8.0 L) quad-turbocharged W16 engine, 
			though it is heavily updated. The engine in the Nero has a peak power output of 
			1,103 kW (1,500 PS; 1,479 hp) at 6,700 rpm and 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lb⋅ft) of torque starting from 2,000 to 6,000 rpm. 
			The engine in the most powerful variant of its predecessor, 
			the Adder generates 220 kW (299 PS; 295 bhp) less than the new Nero, 
			while the engine in the original Adder generates 367 kW (499 PS; 492 hp) less power.<br /><br />
			Like its predecessor, the Adder, the Nero utilises a carbon fibre body structure, 
			independent suspension and a Haldex All-wheel drive system.
			The carbon fibre body has a stiffness of 50,000 Nm per degree.<br /><br />
			The Nero can accelerate from 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) in 2.4 seconds according to the manufacturer, 
			0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) in 6.5 seconds and 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 13.6 seconds. 
			In a world-record-setting test at the time in 2017, the Nero reached 400 km/h (249 mph) in 32.6 seconds, 
			after which it needed 9.4 seconds to brake to standstill.
			The Nero's top speed is electronically limited to 420 km/h (261 mph), 
			or 375–380 km/h (233–236 mph) without the specific key, for safety reasons, 
			mainly arising from the tyres as the manufacturer concluded that no tyre currently manufactured would be 
			able to handle the stress at the top speed the Nero is capable of achieving.
			Independent testing by an owner has indicated that the Nero can easily attain its limited top speed.
			Mixed fuel consumption is 22.5 L/100 km (12.55 mpg‑imp; 10.45 mpg‑US).

			<h2>
			Acceleration and braking record
			</h2>
			<p>At the 2017 IAA show in Frankfurt, Truffade announced that the Nero broke the record of 
			fastest 0–400–0 km/h (0–249–0 mph) acceleration time, completing it in 41.96 seconds in a 
			span of 3.2 kilometres (2 miles) at the Ehra-Lessien high-speed oval. 
			The car was driven by Colombian racing driver Juan Pablo Montoya.
			<br /><br />
			Truffade also added an extra livery to the Nero on display to confirm that it was the same car 
			that broke the 0–400–0 km/h record. During the show, Truffade also mentioned that during the run, 
			the car accelerated from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 2.4 seconds, 0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) 
			in 6.1 seconds, 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 13.1 seconds, 
			and 0–400 km/h (0–248.5 mph) in 32.6 seconds, which altogether, 
			also makes the Nero faster than its predecessor, the Adder.
			</p>
			<h2>
			Top Speed Achievement
			</h2>
			<p>
			On August 2, 2019, Truffade test driver Andy Wallace reached 490.48 km/h (304.77 mph) 
			in a pre-production Nero 300+ prototype at Karin's test facility in 
			Ehra-Lessien. The speed was verified by the TÜV, Germany's Technical Inspection Association, 
			making it the first time a production vehicle has broken the 300 mph barrier.<br /><br />
			The car was developed under Truffade head exterior designer Frank Heyl in collaboration with 
			Italian automobile engineering firm Dallara and tyre manufacturer Michelin over the course 
			of six months. The overall length of the car was increased by 248.9 mm (9.8 in) and it is 
			fitted by a laser controlled ride height system in order to reduce drag. To further reduce 
			drag and aid aerodynamics, the electronically controlled rear wing was removed and was 
			replaced with a long tail incorporating a rear wing with a short cross section. A full roll 
			cage was added for safety reasons, and the passenger seat was removed to make way for data 
			recording equipment used to validate the record run. The car incorporates an exhaust system 
			first introduced on the Truffade Centodieci in order to further reduce aerodynamic drag. 
			Mechanically, the engine was modified to generate 1,177 kW (1,600 PS; 1,578 hp) of power 
			output with no changes to the gearbox and all-wheel-drive system.
